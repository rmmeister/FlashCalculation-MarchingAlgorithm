# FlashCalculation-MarchingAlgorithm
Using compositional approach to model fluid flow and pressure profile along a well.

Use the Beggs and Brill model coupled with flash calculations and find the length of pipe between the points at 1000 psia and 500 psia with the following data in both vertical and horizontal cases. You may assume that the well is producing the hydrocarbon mixture at the rate of 100,000 lb/day.
T=130ºF d= 1.995 in and smooth μL= 17 cp μg= 0.013 cp σL= 30 dyns/cm
